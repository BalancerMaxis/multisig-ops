## [Payload PR - BIP-](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/175)

## Background
The [v3 Weighted Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230206-weighted-pool-v3) and the [v3 Composable Stable Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks//20230206-composable-stable-pool-v3) where deployed to fix reentrancy issue described [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345).  Some initial "wire-up" of permissions is required to bring them into standard function.  This BIP lays out these changes and requests permission to apply them.

## English Specification

The transaction details were generated by [this script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/tools/python/gen_add_permissions_payload.py) with inputs and outputs in [this directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-)

# Specification

As described in the payload json, the authorizer will be called to grant the roles as described.  

The change can be reviewed by the below by comparing the [results_deployment_sorted.md](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-183/results_deployment_sorted.md) file to the source of truth,  which should match the order found in the source of truth for actionIds on the [balancer-v2-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids).

For record, the contents of [results_address_sorted.md](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-/results_address_sorted.md) are printed here:




## Risk Assessment
This BIP is routine operation for provisioning a new factory.  The new factories are themselves a risk mitigation.
