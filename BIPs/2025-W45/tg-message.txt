gm everybody.

all txs for this month are business as usual; three bips that were already in the pipeline.

bip882 rotates the current set of signers (you all) on the treasury to a new set of signers: the treasury council. obviously this is a sensitive tx; please read about it here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-882-transitioning-onchain-operations-of-the-balancer-dao-to-balancer-onchain-limited/6859

bip883 removes an unnecessary permission from the emergency dao msig

bip884 wires up the bal token proxy on ethereum to an erc20 on plasma; this will allow us to activate the gauge system there too
