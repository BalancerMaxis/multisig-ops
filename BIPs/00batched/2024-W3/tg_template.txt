BIP-518&519: Pay Beets SP
BIP-534: Reenable tBTC/WETH gauge on Base


See detailed report here: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/BIPs/00batched/2024-W052/combined-report.md

Sorry I didn't get a BIP together for BAL payouts this week, will be included in next weeks voting, perhaps along with the need not to vote on it every time like other regular funding situatuions such as Karpatkey or Beets.
