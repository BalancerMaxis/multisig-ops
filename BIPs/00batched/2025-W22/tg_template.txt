gm signers!!

light batch this month, but please note the previous txs are still in need of signatures as well!!

biggest transfer is the 2m (vl)aura to a dedicated msig to untangle assets and governance on the dao msig, and make management thereof easier. besides that there is a transfer of $bal to lido in the context of the balancer alliance program & whitelisting their msig for vebal access. lastly killing fraxtal gauges in order to deprecate that chain:

# Ethereum DAO Multisig: https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f
Nonce 267:
